'Oh my god, there are people! What do I do while I'm waiting? I feel so awkward.' I'd pull out my phone, scrolling frantically, just to avoid eye contact with anyone. Anyone at all."}),`
`,t.jsx(e.p,{children:"Then, the dreaded moment: 'Oh, I'm the next one.' My mind would race. 'What should I order? There are so many choices. What's the first sentence I should say to sound less awkward? Should I even look at the barista when I say it?' The truth is, I probably can't do that. I don't think I've ever maintained eye contact with a barista in this café. And that crushing feeling... 'I really feel I can't do this. The people behind me will watch. They'll laugh at me.' Honestly? I'd rather just go without."}),`

With everything planned, I know precisely what I should do; the actions are clear. I feel much more grounded after the planning, and I can practice and desensitize my fear."}),`
`,t.jsx(e.p,{children:"Then, I'd go to the café, take a deep breath, and carry out my plan. It might not be perfect every time, and that's okay. After the interaction, I'd track what went well and what didn't right there in the app. This meant I knew exactly what to focus on for next time, giving me clear steps for improvement."}),`
