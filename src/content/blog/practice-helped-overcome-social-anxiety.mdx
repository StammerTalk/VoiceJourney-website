Ordering coffee. Sounds simple, right? For years, this was my true Everest. I'd walk into a café, and the moment I saw people in line, my heart would just… sink. 'Oh my god, there are people! What do I do while I'm waiting? I feel so awkward.' I'd pull out my phone, scrolling frantically, just to avoid eye contact with anyone. Anyone at all.

Then, the dreaded moment: 'Oh, I'm the next one.' My mind would race. 'What should I order? There are so many choices. What's the first sentence I should say to sound less awkward? Should I even look at the barista when I say it?' The truth is, I probably can't do that. I don't think I've ever maintained eye contact with a barista in this café. And that crushing feeling... 'I really feel I can't do this. The people behind me will watch. They'll laugh at me.' Honestly? I'd rather just go without.

But I was tired of that feeling. Tired of avoiding. I knew I needed to change. That's when I found Voice Journey. It helped me transform that overwhelming fear into something manageable.

## The Structured Approach That Changed Everything

I use the app to plan the ordering: from the task title to the description to the instruction steps. I also write down the phrases to start, so I know exactly what words I use. With everything planned, I know precisely what I should do; the actions are clear. I feel much more grounded after the planning, and I can practice and desensitize my fear.

Then, I'd go to the café, take a deep breath, and carry out my plan. It might not be perfect every time, and that's okay. After the interaction, I'd track what went well and what didn't right there in the app. This meant I knew exactly what to focus on for next time, giving me clear steps for improvement.

## The Transformation

After a few times of this consistent ordering practice, something incredible happened. I felt much more relaxed. My avoidance started shrinking, and I found myself feeling more comfortable to keep eye contact with the barista, and more confident in what I was saying.

Voice Journey truly gave me the clear and structured guidance I needed to practice in real-life situations. If you're ready to take that first step, to transform your own 'Everest' into just a simple order, download Voice Journey. Your voice is waiting.
